# Knexpresso - Concept Document

## Overview

**Knexpresso** is a powerful Node.js utility designed to seamlessly transform any database into a fully functional REST API with minimal configuration. By leveraging **Knex** as the underlying SQL query builder, Knexpresso aims to provide developers with the flexibility to work with a variety of databases, while ensuring a simple and standardized approach to API creation. The utility also automatically generates OpenAPI documentation, making it easier for developers and stakeholders to understand and interact with the API endpoints.

The goal of Knexpresso is to enable rapid backend development, support multiple databases, and provide a hassle-free setup to kickstart API services from existing databases. This is particularly beneficial for projects that need efficient backend solutions without the overhead of manually setting up API endpoints or managing different database intricacies.

## Key Features

1. **Database-Agnostic REST API Generation**:
    - Knexpresso is built around **Knex**, which supports a wide range of SQL databases, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server.
    - With minimal configuration, users can connect Knexpresso to any existing database schema, and it will generate RESTful endpoints to interact with the database tables.

2. **Minimal Setup and Configuration**:
    - The focus is on simplifying the setup to reduce time and effort for developers.
    - A straightforward configuration file allows users to specify database connections, choose the tables to expose, and define basic CRUD operations for each resource.

3. **Automatic OpenAPI Documentation**:
    - Knexpresso will automatically generate **OpenAPI (Swagger)** documentation based on the database schema and the generated REST endpoints.
    - This feature ensures that the APIs are easily discoverable, and consumers can understand how to interact with the service without additional documentation efforts.

4. **Scalability and Extensibility**:
    - Although Knexpresso is designed for minimal configuration, it allows developers to extend the basic functionality.
    - Custom middleware, authentication mechanisms, and advanced query features can be integrated for enhanced control and security.

5. **Built-in Query Capabilities**:
    - Knexpresso provides flexible querying options (e.g., filtering, sorting, pagination) directly through REST endpoints.
    - Developers can leverage Knexâ€™s full power to execute more advanced database operations if required.

## Use Cases

1. **Rapid API Development**:
    - Knexpresso is ideal for quickly prototyping APIs. It significantly reduces the time needed to create data-driven REST services, particularly for proof-of-concept projects or MVPs.

2. **Backend for Frontend Teams**:
    - Frontend developers who need a quick backend solution to interact with their UI can use Knexpresso to generate endpoints without diving deep into backend frameworks.

3. **Legacy System Exposure**:
    - Knexpresso allows legacy databases to be exposed via a modern REST API, making it easier to integrate them with new applications without extensive redevelopment.

## Architectural Overview

- **Node.js and Express**:
    - Built on top of **Express.js**, Knexpresso makes use of its robust request handling and middleware ecosystem.
- **Knex Integration**:
    - Knex acts as the query builder, abstracting away the SQL intricacies, which allows Knexpresso to support multiple databases with a unified interface.
- **API Generation Flow**:
    1. **Configuration**: Users provide a configuration file (`knexpresso.config.js`) that defines the database connection and desired tables.
    2. **Schema Parsing**: Knexpresso parses the database schema and maps it to REST endpoints.
    3. **Automatic Documentation**: The API specifications are documented using **Swagger** for easy integration and interaction.

## Configuration Example

A simple configuration to get started with Knexpresso might look like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  database: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: {
      host: '127.0.0.1',
      user: 'your_user',
      password: 'your_password',
      database: 'your_database',
    },
  },
  tables: [
    {
      name: 'users',
      expose: true,
      permissions: {
        read: true,
        write: true,
        delete: false,
      },
    },
    {
      name: 'orders',
      expose: true,
      permissions: {
        read: true,
        write: false,
        delete: false,
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

In this example:
- The configuration defines the database connection and specifies which tables should be exposed via REST endpoints.
- Permissions can be defined to control which operations are allowed per table.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Knexpresso**:
   ```bash
   npm install knexpresso
   ```
2. **Set Up Configuration**:
    - Create a `knexpresso.config.js` file based on the requirements.
3. **Run Knexpresso**:
   ```bash
   node knexpresso.js
   ```
    - The utility will automatically generate the endpoints and host the REST API.

## Future Plans

- **Authentication and Authorization**:
    - Integration of authentication options, such as JWT or OAuth, to secure the generated endpoints.

- **GraphQL Support**:
    - Considering extending functionality to support GraphQL endpoints, providing even more flexibility in querying.

- **Improved Extensibility**:
    - Add hooks for developers to extend default behaviors, such as custom routes, transformations, and validations.

- **NoSQL Database Support**:
    - Future versions could include support for NoSQL databases, providing the same simple REST API generation for document-based databases.
